# ops-ci-shared

Current version: **v2.8.0**

This repository hosts the CI/CD shell scripts for projects to be deployed into AWS.

This repo was designed to be included into other repo as a git submodule.
After the rollout of `alloy-ch/ops-ci-basics`, the submodule approach was abandoned in favor of GitHub Actions.
