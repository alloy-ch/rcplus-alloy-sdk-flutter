# Alloy SDK QA Flutter App

This is a comprehensive QA testing application for the Alloy Flutter SDK, providing equivalent functionality to the Android and iOS QA app.

## Overview

The QA app allows you to test all major Alloy SDK functionality on both Android and iOS emulators/devices:

- **SDK Initialization**: Initialize the SDK with user identification
- **Visitor Tracking**: Test visitor ID generation and retrieval  
- **Page Analytics**: Track page view events with metadata
- **Contextual Data**: Fetch content analysis data for URLs
- **Segment Data**: Retrieve user segmentation information
- **Consent Management**: Test consent granting/rejection (simulated)

## Setup

### Prerequisites

1. Flutter SDK installed (version 3.0+)
2. Android Studio/Xcode for emulator support
3. The Alloy SDK must be available in the parent `app/` directory

### Installation

```bash
# From the qa_app directory
flutter pub get

# run on emulator or device
flutter emulators --launch apple_ios_simulator
flutter emulators --launch {android_emulator_id}
flutter run
```

Flutter run key commands.
```
r Hot reload. ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥
R Hot restart.
h List all available interactive commands.
d Detach (terminate "flutter run" but leave application running).
c Clear the screen
q Quit (terminate the application on the device).
```

## App Structure

### Two-Tab Interface

**Tab 1: Overview**
- 5 main action buttons testing core SDK functionality
- Real-time feedback via alert dialogs
- Uses sample data matching the Android QA app

**Tab 2: Consent**
- Consent granting/rejection buttons
- Real-time preferences display
- Refresh functionality
- Simulated OneTrust integration

## Testing Scenarios

### Core SDK Functions

1. **Initialize Button**
   - Creates random user IDs (SSO ID + external IDs)
   - Tests `AlloySDK.instance.initialize()`
   - Shows success/failure feedback

2. **Get Visitor ID Button**
   - Retrieves current visitor ID
   - Tests `AlloySDK.instance.visitorID`
   - Handles null cases

3. **Track Pageview Button**
   - Uses rotating sample URLs (example.com, Blick.ch)
   - Tests `AlloySDK.instance.trackPageView()`
   - Includes custom tracking attributes

4. **Fetch Contextual Data Button**
   - Tests content analysis for sample URLs
   - Shows comprehensive response details:
     - Canonical ID
     - Brand safety status  
     - Attribution data
     - IAB categories
     - Content topics

5. **Fetch Segment Data Button**
   - Tests user segmentation API
   - Displays all segment IDs
   - Handles empty results gracefully

### Consent Management

- **Set Consent**: Simulates granting all permissions
- **Disable Consent**: Simulates rejecting all permissions  
- **Refresh**: Updates preference display
- **Live Preferences**: Shows real-time consent state

## Sample Data

The app includes realistic test data:
- Generic landing pages (`example.com/home`)
- Real Swiss news website (`blick.ch`) URLs
- Various content categories and attribution models
- Custom tracking attributes for different content types

## Debug Information

All SDK operations include comprehensive error handling and logging. Check the Flutter console for detailed debug output when `AlloyLogLevel.debug` is enabled.

## Configuration

The app initializes the SDK with development settings:
- **Tenant**: `demo`
- **Environment**: `AlloyEnvironment.staging`
- **App ID**: `qa-flutter-app`
- **Log Level**: `AlloyLogLevel.debug`

Modify these values in `main.dart` as needed for different testing scenarios.

## Platform Support

- âœ… Android emulator/device
- âœ… iOS simulator/device  
- âœ… Hot reload supported (except for native platform channel changes)
- âœ… Cross-platform UI using Material 3 design

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Import errors**: Run `flutter pub get` to ensure dependencies are installed
2. **Platform channel errors**: Restart the app (not just hot reload) after SDK changes
3. **Network errors**: Check that staging endpoints are accessible
4. **Consent state issues**: Currently simulated - real OneTrust integration would require additional setup

### Development Tips

- Use `flutter analyze` to check for code issues
- Use `flutter clean && flutter pub get` after SDK updates
- Check logs in debug console for detailed error information
- Test on both platforms to ensure cross-platform compatibility
